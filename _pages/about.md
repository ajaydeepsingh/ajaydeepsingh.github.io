Hi, I'm Ajay and I live in Detroit, Michigan. I graduated with a degree in computer science from <a href="http://www.gatech.edu/"> Georgia Tech</a> with a primary concentration in cyber security and software development. I have previously worked for the the Georgia Tech Cyber Security Department, for <a href="http://www.mailchimp.com/"> MailChimp</a> as a Software Engineer Intern and most recently with <a href="https://corporate.ford.com/articles/products/ford-producing-ventilators-for-coronavirus-patients.html"> Ford </a>contributing to the production of 50,000 ventilators for FEMA use and building awesome software tools.

Thanks for visiting my site!

I program, take photos, and write about things that interest me when I have the time. More information can be found through <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/singhajaydeep/" data-network="LinkedIn" data-proofer-ignore>LinkedIn.</a>
