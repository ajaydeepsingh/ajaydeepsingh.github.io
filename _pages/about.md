Hi, I'm Ajay and I live in Atlanta, Georgia. I am a computer science major at  <a href="http://www.gatech.edu/"> Georgia Tech</a> with a primary interest in cybersecurity and networks. I have previously worked for the the Georgia Tech Cyber Security Department and most recently worked for <a href="http://www.mailchimp.com/"> MailChimp</a> as a Network Automation Intern.

Thanks for visiting my site!

I program, take photos, and write about things that interest me when I have the time. More information can be found through <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/singhajaydeep/" data-network="LinkedIn" data-proofer-ignore>LinkedIn.</a>
